## The thesis: **HTML-ization**

Stop sending dead files. Every report, pitch, audit, deck, and analysis ships
as a live interactive HTML artifact on a deployed link — not a PDF attachment
that started rotting the second it was exported. The link is current because
the repo is. People forward links; they archive PDFs unread.

**This repo is the proof.** The book about building this kind of artifact is,
itself, this kind of artifact — a private GitHub repo deployed to a public
link, updated by commit, with two real interactive case studies embedded and
clickable inside it.

## Read it (the site is the book)

The repo is how it's built. The site is what it IS.

| Surface | What's there | Live link |
|---|---|---|
| **All 43 chapters** | The whole book, MDX-rendered, with TL;DRs, glossary tooltips, code blocks, and the receipts behind every claim | [`/chapters`](https://dive.vladyslavpodoliako.com/sections) |
| **HTML-ization** | The flagship — thesis + 3 embedded live artifacts (AFC pitch deck, AFC robot stable, sanitized client deliverability audit) | [`/html-first`](https://dive.vladyslavpodoliako.com/html-first) |
| **Tier list** | Every tool ranked without diplomatic phrasing, plus the live LMArena leaderboard widget | [`/tier-list`](https://dive.vladyslavpodoliako.com/tier-list) |
| **Cheat sheet** | 16 reference sections — slash commands, settings keys, hook JSON shape, permission syntax, model routing — printable | [`/cheat-sheet`](https://dive.vladyslavpodoliako.com/cheat-sheet) |
| **Glossary** | 56 terms, A–Z, linked inline throughout the chapters | [`/glossary`](https://dive.vladyslavpodoliako.com/glossary) |
| **Resources** | Copy-paste templates: CLAUDE.md skeletons, .mcp.json, hooks, SKILL.md, subagent .md, Docker sandbox + devcontainer, 18 reusable prompts | [`/resources`](https://dive.vladyslavpodoliako.com/resources) |
| **Research notes** | 9 external signals that shift what to do Monday — sourced, dated, signal-vs-receipt discipline | [`/research-notes`](https://dive.vladyslavpodoliako.com/research-notes) |
| **The 12-rule CLAUDE.md** | Karpathy's 4 + 8 operator additions, with a receipt per rule | [`/claude-md-rules`](https://dive.vladyslavpodoliako.com/claude-md-rules) |

| **30-day plan** | Custom roadmap with markdown + .ics export | [`/thirty-day-plan`](https://dive.vladyslavpodoliako.com/thirty-day-plan) |

Press **⌘K** anywhere on the site — search every chapter, page, section
anchor, glossary term, and research note from one box.

## The 3 case studies, embedded and clickable

The HTML-ization page doesn't *describe* the method — it shows it, with three
real artifacts the operator-Claude workflow produced:

- **AFC — the pitch deck.** Vlad's "Autonomous Fighting Championship" — a
  dinner-table idea ("robots in an octagon"); friends asked for a deck; one got
  spun up fast as interactive HTML before the next meeting did. ([open it](https://dive.vladyslavpodoliako.com/artifacts/afc-pitch.html))
- **AFC — the robot stable.** Companion doc: every humanoid platform shipping
  in 2026, filterable, with a profit-per-fighter calculator. ([open it](https://dive.vladyslavpodoliako.com/artifacts/afc-robots.html))
- **The 90-domain deliverability audit (sanitized sample).** A real Folderly
  external audit of a ~90-domain / ~5K-mailbox cold-email estate — swarmed in
  days, delivered as a clickable interactive doc instead of a 40-page PDF.
  Client, every domain, every infra fingerprint de-identified before
  publication. ([open it](https://dive.vladyslavpodoliako.com/artifacts/deliverability-audit-sample.html))

## What's in this repo (the receipts)

- **43 chapters** in `src/content/chapters/*.mdx`
- **25 React/Astro widgets** in `src/widgets/` (live LMArena leaderboard, sortable tier list, command palette, token-burn calculator, swarm visualizer, persona-agent walkthrough, …)
- **25 standalone pages** in `src/pages/` (the surfaces in the table above + the journey, sections index, showcase, vault starter, weekend builds, and more)
- **56 glossary terms** in `src/lib/glossary.ts`
- **9 dated research notes** in `src/lib/research-notes.ts`
- **3 embedded interactive artifacts** in `public/artifacts/` — single-file, self-contained, sandboxed-iframe-embedded on `/html-first`
- **18 copy-paste prompt templates + 9 hook templates + 5 CLAUDE.md skeletons + 8 SKILL.md templates** in `src/lib/snippets.ts`

The auto-updated [LMArena leaderboard widget](https://dive.vladyslavpodoliako.com/tier-list)
pulls live from the HuggingFace datasets-server API — the rest of the site is
static HTML.

## How it's built (5 bullets)

   default; React 18 islands only where interaction needs them.
   (`<Callout>`, `<PullQuote>`, `<TLDR>`, `<ScreenshotPlaceholder>`,
   `<GlossaryTooltip>`).
   (`--accent: #FF6B2C`, `--paper`, `--line`, etc.).
   `main`, live in ~90 seconds at `dive.vladyslavpodoliako.com`.
   widget builds, design system, security scrubbing, deploy pipeline. The
   process is the technique the book describes; the artifact IS the technique.

---


## Add a chapter

   `src/content/config.ts`.
To add a whole new page (resources, /tier-list-style surface, etc.), the
six wiring surfaces are codified in the
[`playbook-new-page`](https://github.com/shogunsystemhovel/ai-dive-deep-986) skill: page
file · ⌘K index · chapter cross-link · glossary term · **homepage tile** ·
changelog.
